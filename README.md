## <a name="reason">Why I built this</a>

- to get to coding after not touching it for 3 whole months! This is a rebuilt version of my original pexels clone. This project only has the photo section, searchbar and photo download parts working so this is a lesser version of the old one
- But i do feel like the code here is a bit cleaner, at least for me and I learned tailwindcss which i've been dreading about for a long time and I feel a bit better now.
- Still, there's a lot of things I still don't know. In fact, I am pretty sure that I am an absolute idiot in react and js so gonna be keep learning.
- Am I proud of this project? I don't think I am. Considering that this is the most basic thing you could build, I spent like 4days which is ok i guess since i am crap at this.
